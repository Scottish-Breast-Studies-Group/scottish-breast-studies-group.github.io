### SALTO: Scottish Audit of Lung Toxicity with Novel Oncology Therapies.  
* **Purpose:** The study aims to evaluate the "real world" impact of the drug Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) on Scottish patients. Specifically, it focuses on monitoring the rates and management of a potentially serious lung side effect called Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), while simultaneously tracking how well the drug works in extending life and delaying cancer progression.  
* **Population:** Patients in Scotland receiving T-DXd for HER2-positive or HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.  
* **Method:** This is a multicentre clinical audit (retrospective data collection). It reviews patient records to see how the drug is performing outside of strictly controlled clinical trials.  
* **Key Outcomes:** ***Safety:*** Rates of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and how it is managed when it occurs. ***Efficacy:*** Response Rates (how much the tumour shrinks), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Overall Survival (OS).  
* **Scope:** Pan-Scotland (involving major Scottish cancer centres).  
* **Lead Investigator:** Sophie Barrett  
* ***Why it matters*** *T-DXd has been a game-changer for metastatic breast cancer, but it carries a known risk of lung toxicity (ILD/pneumonitis) which can be fatal if not caught early. Clinical trials happen in controlled environments; this audit is necessary to ensure that in the "real world," Scottish patients are being monitored safely and are achieving the survival benefits seen in global trials.*
