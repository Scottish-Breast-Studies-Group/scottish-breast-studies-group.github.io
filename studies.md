### SALTO: Scottish Audit of Lung Toxicity with Novel Oncology Therapies.  
* **Purpose:** The study aims to evaluate the "real world" impact of the drug Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) on Scottish patients. Specifically, it focuses on monitoring the rates and management of a potentially serious lung side effect called Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), while simultaneously tracking how well the drug works in extending life and delaying cancer progression.  
* **Population:** Patients in Scotland receiving T-DXd for HER2-positive or HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.  
* **Method:** This is a multicentre clinical audit (retrospective data collection). It reviews patient records to see how the drug is performing outside of strictly controlled clinical trials.  
* **Key Outcomes:** ***Safety:*** Rates of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and how it is managed when it occurs. ***Efficacy:*** Response Rates (how much the tumour shrinks), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Overall Survival (OS).  
* **Scope:** Pan-Scotland (involving major Scottish cancer centres).  
* **Lead Investigator:** Sophie Barrett  
* ***Why it matters*** *T-DXd has been a game-changer for metastatic breast cancer, but it carries a known risk of lung toxicity (ILD/pneumonitis) which can be fatal if not caught early. Clinical trials happen in controlled environments; this audit is necessary to ensure that in the "real world," Scottish patients are being monitored safely and are achieving the survival benefits seen in global trials.*

## Completed Studies

Williams, L.J., Kunkler, I.H., Taylor, K.J., Dunlop, J., Piper, T., Caldwell, J., Jack, W., Loane, J.F., Elder, K., Bartlett, J.M. and Dixon, J.M., 2024. Postoperative radiotherapy in women with early operable breast cancer (**Scottish Breast Conservation Trial**): 30-year update of a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. The Lancet Oncology, 25(9), pp.1213-1221.[Fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00347-4/abstract)  
***Key Takeaway:*** *Confirmed that while radiotherapy reduces local recurrence, omitting it in this specific low-risk population did not compromise overall survival even after 30 years.*

Kunkler, I.H., Russell, N.S., Anderson, N., Sainsbury, R., Dixon, J.M., Cameron, D., Loncaster, J., Hatton, M., Westenberg, H., Clarke, J. and McCarty, H., 2025. Ten-year survival after postmastectomy chest-wall irradiation in breast cancer. New England Journal of Medicine, 393(18), pp.1771-1783.[Fulltext](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2412225)  
***Key Takeaway:*** *The **SUPREMO Trial** found no overall survival benefit to adding chest-wall radiation for women with "intermediate-risk" breast cancer (e.g., 1–3 positive nodes) who had undergone mastectomy and standard systemic therapy.*  

Peters, A.L., Hall, P.S., Jordan, L.B., Soh, F.Y., Hannington, L., Makaranka, S., Urquhart, G., Vallet, M., Cartwright, D., Marashi, H. and Elsberger, B., 2024.

***Key Takeaway:*** *Progesterone Receptor (PR) Allred score is a strong independent predictor of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score. Patients with a negative PR score were significantly more likely to have a high Recurrence Score (indicating a higher risk of the cancer returning), a relationship that previous key studies had not fully evaluated.*

Antibiotic prophylaxis in breast cancer surgery (**PAUS trial**): randomised clinical double-blind parallel-group multicentre superiority trial. British Journal of Surgery, 109(12), pp.1224-1231. [Fulltext](https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/109/12/1224/6657706)  
***Key Takeaway:*** *A single pre-operative dose of antibiotics (co-amoxiclav) did not significantly reduce wound infection rates in routine breast cancer surgery, supporting a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use.*

***Key Takeaway:*** *Established that totally implantable ports (PORTs) are superior to Hickman and PICC lines in terms of safety and quality of life for patients receiving long-term chemotherapy.*
