The **Scottish Breast Studies Group (SBSG)** is a multidisciplinary forum for clinicians, scientists, and healthcare professionals dedicated to the treatment and research of breast cancer and breast disease.

### Mission
1.  **Collaboration:** To foster links between breast units across Scotland.
2.  **Research:** To support and initiate multi-centre studies.

### Study Endorsement
The Scottish Breast Studies Group provides formal endorsement for projects aiming to improve breast cancer care and outcomes. We welcome applications for the endorsement of research studies, clinical audits, and service evaluations.

#### Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for SBSG endorsement, a project must:

- Be Multi-site: The project must involve multiple centers to ensure a broad impact across the clinical community.

- Have a Scottish Focus: The project must include at least one Scottish center and be led by a Lead Investigator based in Scotland.

- Demonstrate Value: The work must align with the strategic goals of improving breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, or patient experience.

#### How to Apply
Investigators seeking SBSG endorsement should submit their project protocol (or a detailed summary for audits/evaluations) and a statement of objectives to the Group Secretary (secretary@sbsg.scot)

The SBSG executive will review the submission to ensure it meets the group's standards for scientific or clinical merit before issuing a formal letter of endorsement.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> While the SBSG endorses research, audits, and service evaluations, please note that SBSG endorsement <strong>does not</strong> constitute automatic adoption onto the NHS Research Scotland (NRS) Portfolio. NRS Portfolio eligibility is governed by the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) and typically applies only to research studies with national, peer-reviewed funding. Most audits and service evaluations are ineligible for Portfolio support. To confirm if your project qualifies for NRS infrastructure support, please consult the <a href="https://www.nrs.org.uk" style="color: #666; text-decoration: underline;">NHS Research Scotland website</a> or contact your host NHS Board’s Research and Development (R&D) office.
